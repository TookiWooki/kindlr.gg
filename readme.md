Game-ification
    - stickers are used much like twitch bits
    - when a campaign creator creates pledge tiers, they attach an image that shows the purpose/reward of that
    tier and then the user pledges by purchasing that pledge tier sticker (1 sticker = $1). 
        - The user who pledged can then decorate thier profile page with those collected stickers.
        - Stickers and thier totals are displayed on the campaign.
