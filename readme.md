Kindlr.gg

A place for game developers to gain funding for thier project.
    - One-time funding for: game, game mechanic, game art, story development, etc
    - Ongoing funding based on tiers setup by the creator.

A place for gamer to find, fund, and play new games while being apart of them game's development community.


Steam API "based"
    - Kindlr is very intertwined with Steam and the user's profile/data
        - how Kindlr gives game recommendations: based on Steam library

Homepage featured
    - right side displays Recommended For You if the user is not signed in
    - right side displays Your Activity on Kindlr if the user is signed in

Game-ification
    - stickers are used much like twitch bits
    - when a campaign creator creates pledge tiers, they attach an image that shows the purpose/reward of that
    tier and then the user pledges by purchasing that pledge tier sticker (1 sticker = $1). 
        - The user who pledged can then decorate thier profile page with those collected stickers.
        - Stickers and thier totals are displayed on the campaign.

Backend (idk what this entails exactly yet..)
    - Firebase
        - I've read its best to have all folders as main folders and try not to save information too many levels deep in the tree. That way I only pull the information I need instead of all the information above in the same tree. ex: instead of having projects folder inside of the creators folder, I will have them as seperate directories with information linking the two within each? I can't see me having to update the information within too often so this should be ok..# kindlr.gg
